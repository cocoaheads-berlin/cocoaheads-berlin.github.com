#CocoaHeads Berlin Website Re-design Competition

We are the Berlin chapter of [Cocoaheads](http://www.cocoaheads.org). We meet once every month and talk about iOS and OS X development and our [current website](http://cocoaheads-berlin.org) is in need of a redesign. That's why we are organizing this competition and give you a chance to win a ticket to [Mobile Central Europe 2015](http://mceconf.com), in addition to fame, fortune and our everlasting gratitude… 

Here are the rules:

- Design a new CocoaHeads Berlin website where visitors can reach the following: our meetups, a news/updates section and our videos.
- Feel free to work in teams but if you win, you get ticket to share among the team…
- Submit your design (preferably with live-preview) until October 31st 2014 to ekurutepe@gmail.com. 
- All submissions will be opened to public vote for a week. 
- After the end of the voting week, the design with most votes wins and the creator(s) get(s) one free ticket to MCE 2015

Looking forward to great website re-designs!
