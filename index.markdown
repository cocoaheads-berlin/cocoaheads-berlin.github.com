#Welcome to Berlin CocoaHeads!

We are the Berlin chapter of [Cocoaheads](http://www.cocoaheads.org). We meet once every month and talk about iOS and OS X development. If you're into Cocoa and in Berlin, come in and say hi.

Follow us on Twitter: [@cocoaheads_Ber](https://twitter.com/cocoaheads_BER)

Watch our talks on Vimeo: [CocoaHeads Berlin Channel](https://vimeo.com/channels/cocoaheadsberlin)

We're also on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Cocoaheads-Berlin/)

# Next meetings

###Aug 20th, 19:00 – CocoaHeads BBQ

We're holding a BBQ-party!

There is going to be some beer. Feel free to bring whatever else you would like to drink and put on the grill. We're also planning to do a trip to a nearby supermarket at 19:00, you can join too if you need to get some supplies.
